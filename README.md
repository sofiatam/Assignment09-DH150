# Trends n Friends

## About Trends n Friends
Yelp is a popular platform for community members to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.), but it lacks a social component that is both practical and useful. For my project, Trends n Friends, I chose to focus on the restaurant aspect of Yelp and capitalize on the socialness of eating. Trends n Friends introduces a new feature on Yelp, called "Discover," that incorporates "Trending," "Friends," and "Updates" maps to transition Yelp into a social platform.


## Design statement
Beside being a necessity of life, eating has become an increasingly social occurence. With the rise of social networks, the food experience should address this changing culture by introducing its own social aspect. Trends n Friends resolves this issue by adding a social feature to Yelp. Not only would users continue to use Yelp for its primary features, but Trends n Friends would allow for a seamless food experience- from finding a restaurant, going to it, and ultimately sharing the experience.


## Competitor analysis
Besides Yelp, one of their competitors is OpenTable, a part of Booking.com, that provides a similar service to Yelp in that it allows for searching of restaurants, booking of reservations, and writing of reviews. Both of these services help provide users (+ aspiring foodies) with a streamlined food experience.

#### Comparison of Yelp and OpenTable

## User research
I conducted user research on a person who falls into Yelp's target demographic by asking them to find a restaurant to eat at. Currently, the means to complete such a task include word-of-mouth and using the internet. There are various sites that exist to share restaurants, like Yelp, Google, and TripAdvisor. Since I, myself, am a Yelp user, it was interesting to see how someone else was led to use Yelp and utilized it during the user testing.

## UX storytelling
I created three personas that fall into the target demographic for my Yelp feature:

</tr>
</table>


I also created three scenarios that demonstrated the use of the feature I am introducing for Yelp:
- Scenario #1: See what restaurants are trending in a particular area
- Scenario #2: See business updates for particular occassions
- Scenario #3: See where your friends are currently eating

See how my personas would perform in these scenarios [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment05-DH150).

## Low-fidelity prototype
I created a low-fidelity prototype to outline the flow of my feature. Here is what the final revised prototype looks like:

See my original wireflow, edits, and comments [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment06-DH150).


## High-fidelity prototype
Then, I created a high-fidelity prototype that was an interactive version of my low-fidelity prototype. Here is what the wireflow looks like:

## Evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

I also audited the accessibility of Yelp's website to see how ADA compatible it was. I also tested various color schemes 


I also conducted usability tests to see how usable the website Yelp was. The purpose of usability tests is to evaluate a site's interface and notice flaws in its usability. For the usability tests, I created tasks that addressed these heuristic issues I previously noticed:
- Difficulties in filtering search results
- Sponsored results distort actual search results
- Certain site features are difficult to find
