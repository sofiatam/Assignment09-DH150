# Trends n Friends
## DH 150 UX Design, Sofia Tam

## About Trends n Friends
Yelp is a popular platform for community members to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.), but it lacks a social component that is both practical and useful. For my project, Trends n Friends, I chose to focus on the restaurant aspect of Yelp and capitalize on the socialness of eating. Trends n Friends introduces a new feature on Yelp, called "Discover," that incorporates "Trending," "Friends," and "Updates" maps to help transition Yelp into a successful social platform.


## Design statement
Beside being a necessity of life, eating has become an increasingly social occurence. With the rise of social networks, the food experience should address this changing culture by introducing its own social aspect. Trends n Friends resolves this issue by adding a social feature to Yelp. Not only would users continue to use Yelp for its primary features, but Trends n Friends would allow for a seamless food experience- from finding a restaurant, going to it, and ultimately sharing the experience.


## Competitor analysis
Besides Yelp, one of their competitors is OpenTable, a part of Booking.com, that provides a similar service to Yelp in that it allows for searching of restaurants, booking of reservations, and writing of reviews. Both of these services help provide users (+ aspiring foodies) with a streamlined food experience.

#### Comparison of Yelp and OpenTable

## User research
I conducted user research on a person who falls into Yelp's target demographic by asking them to find a restaurant to eat at. Currently, the means to complete such a task include word-of-mouth and using the internet. There are various sites that exist to share restaurants, like Yelp, Google, and TripAdvisor. Since I, myself, am a Yelp user, it was interesting to see how someone else was led to use Yelp and utilized it during the user testing. 

Read more about my contextual inquiry and user research [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment04-DH150).


## UX storytelling
I created three personas that fall into the target demographic for my Yelp feature:

<table>
<tr>
  <td> <img width="1440" alt="Tyler" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25126263/74080050-beca5380-49f4-11ea-96a9-d8c3bec704bb.png"> </td>
  <td> <img width="1440" alt="Justine" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25126263/74080054-c4c03480-49f4-11ea-93d7-83c52b0a7a8b.png"> </td>
  <td> <img width="1440" alt="Kelly" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25126263/74080056-c7228e80-49f4-11ea-9d91-08ab2727a0d5.png"> </td>
</tr>
</table>


I also created three scenarios that demonstrated the use of the feature I am introducing for Yelp:
- Scenario #1: See what restaurants are trending in a particular area
- Scenario #2: See business updates for particular occassions
- Scenario #3: See where your friends are currently eating

See how my personas would perform in these scenarios [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment05-DH150).


## Wireframe and graphic design element variation
My wireframes were inspired by Yelp's existing user interface, so that the integration of my feature would be intuitive to existing Yelp users. Click [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment06-DH150) to see more on my initial wireframes.

Since I tried to maintain Yelp's existing user interface, I tested different graphic design elements and color schemes [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment07-DH150). 

After creating the wireframes and testing different graphic design elements for my feature, I created example wireflows for it. Here is an example of a sample screen showing the "Trending" map:

Read more about my wireflows and wireframes [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment08-DH150).


## Low-fidelity prototype
I created a low-fidelity prototype to outline the flow of my feature. Low fidelity prototypes are useful to see how the user thinks when presented with a potential solution, and allows people like me to observe how the user thinks and logically map out how the new features will behave. Here is what the final revised prototype looks like:

See my original wireflow, edits, and comments [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment06-DH150).


## High-fidelity prototype
Then, I created a high-fidelity prototype that was an interactive version of my low-fidelity prototype. Here is what the wireflow looks like:

## Evaluation and revision history 
I also conducted usability tests to see how usable the website Yelp was. The purpose of usability tests is to evaluate a site's interface and notice flaws in its usability. For the usability tests, I created tasks that addressed these heuristic issues I previously noticed:
- Difficulties in filtering search results
- Sponsored results distort actual search results
- Certain site features are difficult to find

Read more about my usability test [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment02-DH150).


I audited the accessibility of Yelp's website to see how ADA compatible it was. I also tested various color schemes for their accessibility. See the results of Yelp's accessibility test [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment07-DH150/blob/master/audit-YELP.pdf).

## Conclusion
Throughout this entire process, the most important lesson I learned was to put the user first. The user should be the driving factor for the project because in the end, this feature is created exclusively for the user. Starting from user research and usability testing all the way to creating interactive prototypes, the user is always kept in mind. Additionally, I learned technical skills such as how to conduct user interviews, create personas and scenarios, and design prototypes.

In the future, or if I had additional time, I would try to conduct more user research to further identify pain points. This would give me a more holistic view of Yelp and its areas for improvement. User research is incredibly helpful for guiding a project because it tells you exactly what the user wants/currently lacks. I would have also looked more into the competitive landscape regarding Yelp to get a better idea of what other companies are doing with regards to integrating socialness into their services. This way, I would be able to see if any platforms offer existing solutions to the problem area I described previously. 

My project, Trends n Friends, connects people with food by providing a seamless food experience on Yelp.
