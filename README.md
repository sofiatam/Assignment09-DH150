# Project title
## DH 150 Winter 2020, Sofia Tam

## About the [project title]:
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution. (2-3 sentences)


## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

I hope to impact the food community by providing foodies (+ aspring foodies) with a seamless and efficient food-related experience.


## Competitor analysis:
Yelp is a popular platform for customers to publish reviews for different types of businesses (restaurants, shops, services, etc.). OpenTable, which is a part of Booking.com, provides a similar service to Yelp in that it allows for searching of restaurants, booking of reservations, and writing of reviews. Both of these services help provide users (+ aspiring foodies) with a streamlined food experience. Read more [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment01-DH150). See usability testing [here](https://github.com/sofiatam/Assignment02-DH150).
